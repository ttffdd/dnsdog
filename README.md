# dnsdog


Pretty simple script to get alerts from dns-server to tg. Also control size of log.

## Usage
1. Install pyinotify and telegram modules.
2. Follow comments and replace stubs in code by yours values.
3. Run.

## TODO
* Replace stubs by commandline arguments
* In case of tg error save alerts to buffer and push them together after restart.
